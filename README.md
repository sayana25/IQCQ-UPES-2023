# IQCQ-UPES-2023
This repository contains some google colab created jupyter notebooks for my lecture at the IQCQ-2023 conference at University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), Dehradun, India. We start with having a look at the IBM composer which is a fun way for beginners to start learning about gates and operations in QISKIT. 
We start with the statevector representation, representing kets, bras and unitary matrices. Then we get to the creating of basic quantum circuits starting with single qubit gates, theri representation and then go into compartively more complicated circuits with multi-qubit gates and running them on the QASM simulator. 
Level 3 : Quantum Fourier Transform 
Level 4 : CHSH inequality(?) and Quantum teleportation 

The labs and exercises have been created based on labs given in QGSS 2021, QGSS 2023, Qiskit Fall Fests - 2023.
